A C++17 and onwards tool to parse command line arguments in your project using regex. Just
include `argparser.hpp` to your project and you are good to go.


# Obtaining

The `argparser.hpp` single C++ header can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/makuke1234/argparser/releases).


# Testing

The product has been lightly tested, so no guarantees. In all honesty the parser
should work fairly well because it relies heavily on STL and minimal complexity
has been added to that, the whole header is only 126 SLOC.


# License

The project uses MIT License, so feel free to suit it to your own liking.
